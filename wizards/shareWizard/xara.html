    How to add your form into a Web Designer web page:

<p class="locale">
    If you used Web Designerâ€™s Designs Gallery to add a JotForm form, simply click the Insert button at the bottom of this browser window. This window will close and a few seconds later you should see an image of your form appear on your page. Preview the page to test the working form.
</p>
<p class="locale">
    If you came to JotForm using a separate web browser instead of using the Web Designer Designs Gallery, click on the code above to select it, then copy it (Ctrl+C). Then go into the Selector Tool in Web Designer 6 and paste (Ctrl+V). An image of your form will appear on your page. Preview the page to test the working form.

    If you are using an older version of Web Designer, you need to use Utilities->Web properties, Placeholder tab, to insert the HTML code attached to a placeholder object.
